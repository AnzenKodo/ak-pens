## Definition of Constant

A fixed value.

In Algebra, a constant is a number on its own, or sometimes a letter such as $a$, $b$ or $c$ to stand for a fixed number.

Example: in $x + 5 = 9$, $5$ and $9$ are constants.

## Definition of Coefficient

A number used to multiply a variable.

Example: $6z$ means $6$ times $z$, and "$z$" is a variable, so $6$ is a coefficient.

Variables with no number have a coefficient of 1.
Example: $x$ is really $1x$.

Sometimes a letter stands in for the number.
Example: In $ax2 + bx + c$, "$x$" is a variable, and "$a$" and "$b$" are coefficients.

## Definition of Variable

A symbol for a value we don't know yet. It is usually a letter like $x$ or $y$.

Example: in $x + 2 = 6$, $x$ is the variable.
