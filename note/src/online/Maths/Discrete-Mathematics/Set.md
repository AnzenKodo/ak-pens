# Set
**Note:**
- Info:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)
- Set is denoted by capital letter such as A, B, C, D.

## Set symbols
- $\emptyset$ - The empty set.
- $\mathbb{N}$ - Set of natural numbers.
  - $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ - Set of integers.
  - $..., -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - Set of rational numbers.
  - $a/b$, $a \over b$, $- { 125 \over 37}$
- $\mathbb{A}$ - Set of algebraic numbers.
  - $-1-\sqrt{-23} \over 4$
- $\mathbb{R}$ - Set of real numbers.
  - $-1-\sqrt{-23} \over 4$
- $\mathbb{C}$ - Set of complex numbers.
  - $z = a + bi$
  - $a$ and $b$ is real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.
- $\mathbb{H}$ - Set of quaternions.
  - $H = \begin{bmatrix} z & w \\ -\overline{w} & \overline{z}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a + ib & c + id \\ -c + id & a - ib\end{bmatrix}$
- $\mathbb{O}$ - Set of octonions.
  - $\{e_1, e_1, e_2, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\}$
- $\mathbb{S}$ - Set of sedenions.
  - $x = x_0 e_0 + x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + ... + x_{14} e_{14} + x_{15} e_{15}$

## Set Logic
- $\in$ - is member of.
  - $x \in (0, 1)$ that means $0 < x < 1$.
  - $x \in [0, 1)$ that means $0 \leq x$.
    - The square bracket ($[$) means $\leq$.
  - $x \in [0, 1]$ that means $0 \leq x \leq 1$.
  - $A \in B$ - is the set of all objects that are a member of _A_, or _B_, or both.
- $\notin$ - is not member of
- $\ni$ - owns (has member).
- $\subset$ - is proper subset of.
- $\subseteq$ - is subset of.
  - If all the members of set _A_ are also members of set _B_, then _A_ is a _[subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset "Subset")_ of _B_, denoted _A_ ⊆ _B_.
  - ${1, 2}$ is a subset of ${1, 2, 3}$, and so is ${2}$ but ${1, 4}$ is not.
- $\supset$ - is proper superset of.
- $\subseteq$ - is superset of.

## Operations
- $\cup$ - set union.
  - _A_ ∪ _B_, is the set of all objects that are a member of _A_, or _B_, or both.
  - The union of {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is the set {1, 2, 3, 4}.
- $\cap$ - set intersection.
  - _A_ ∩ _B_, is the set of all objects that are members of both _A_ and _B_.
  - The intersection of {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is the set {2, 3}.
- $\setminus$ - set difference.
  -  _U_ \ _A_, is the set of all members of _U_ that are not members of _A_.
  -  The set difference {1, 2, 3} \ {2, 3, 4} is {1}, while conversely, the set difference {2, 3, 4} \ {1, 2, 3} is {4}.
