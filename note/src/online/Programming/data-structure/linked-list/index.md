## What is traverse?

1. To traverse a data structure means to visit each element in the structure,
   usually in a systematic way. In the context of a linked list, traversing the
   list means visiting each node in the list, usually by following the next
   pointers from one node to the next.
2. For example, if you have a linked list with nodes A, B, C, and D, and you
   want to traverse the list, you might start at node A and follow the next
   pointer to node B, then follow the next pointer to node C, and so on, until
   you reach the end of the list.
3. Traversing a linked list can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as
   searching for a specific element, updating the values of certain elements, or
   simply printing out all the elements in the list.

## What is queue?

1. A queue is a linear data structure that allows for the insertion of elements
   at one end (called the back or rear of the queue) and the deletion of
   elements at the other end (called the front or head of the queue). This is
   known as a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) structure, as the elements that are
   inserted first are also the first to be removed.
2. Queues are often used to store data that needs to be processed in a specific
   order, or to store data that will be used by multiple consumers. For example,
   a printer queue might store print jobs that need to be printed in the order
   they were received, or a task queue might store tasks that need to be
   completed by a set of worker threads.
3. Queues are useful for storing and managing data in a way that ensures that
   elements are processed in a specific order, and that no element is processed
   more than once. They can be implemented using a variety of data structures,
   such as arrays, linked lists, or circular linked lists.
