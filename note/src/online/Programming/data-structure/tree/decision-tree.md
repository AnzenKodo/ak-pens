A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure that is used to make a
decision or prediction based on multiple conditions. It is a supervised learning
algorithm, which means that it is trained on a labeled dataset, where the
correct output is already known.

The decision tree algorithm works by starting at the root node and asking a
series of questions based on the features of the data. Each question splits the
data into two branches, and the algorithm continues to ask questions and split
the data until it reaches a leaf node, which represents a prediction or
decision.

The goal of the decision tree algorithm is to create a tree that accurately
predicts the target variable based on the features of the data. The accuracy of
the prediction is determined by how well the tree is able to classify the
training data.

Decision trees are often used for classification tasks, such as determining
whether a given email is spam or not, or for regression tasks, such as
predicting the price of a house based on its features. They are also commonly
used in data mining and machine learning applications.
