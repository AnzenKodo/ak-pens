## 1) DFS and BFS / Algo / Sum / 5 adv

| DFS                                                             | BFS                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - DFS goes to the bottom of a subtree, then backtracks.         | - The full form of BFS is Breadth-First Search                  |
| - DFS is Depth-First Search.                                    | - BFS finds the shortest path to the destination                |
| - DFS uses a stack to keep track of the next location to visit. | - BFS uses a queue to keep track of the next location to visit. |
| - DFS traverses according to tree depth.                        | - BFS traverses according to tree level.                        |
| - DFS is implemented using a LIFO list.                         | - BFS is implemented using a FIFO list.                         |
