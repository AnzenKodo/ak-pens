A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the last node points to
the first node, creating a circular chain. This structure has several advantages
over a traditional linear linked list:

1. It allows for easier traversal: In a circular linked list, you can traverse
   the entire list by starting at any node and following the next pointers until
   you reach the starting node again. In a linear linked list, you would have to
   check whether you have reached the end of the list at each step.
2. It allows for efficient insertion and deletion at the beginning or end of the
   list: In a circular linked list, the last node is always adjacent to the
   first node, so you can easily insert or delete nodes at either end of the
   list without having to traverse the entire list.
3. It allows for efficient implementation of queue data structures: A queue is a
   data structure that allows for insertion at one end (the back of the queue)
   and deletion at the other end (the front of the queue). In a circular linked
   list, you can implement a queue by keeping a pointer to both the front and
   back of the queue and using the next pointers to move between nodes. This
   allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations.

Overall, the use of a circular linked list can make certain operations more
efficient compared to a linear linked list, particularly when it comes to
inserting and deleting nodes at the beginning or end of the list, or when
implementing queue data structures.
