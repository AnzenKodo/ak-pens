Keys are used to uniquely identify any record or row of data from the table. It
is also used to establish and identify relationships between tables.

**Example:** ID is used as a key in the "student" table because it is unique for
each student.

  a tuple.
- The candidate keys are as strong as the primary key.
- Example: "employee" table, id is best suited for the primary key. The rest of
  the attributes like SSN, Passport_Number, License_Number are considered a
  candidate key.

## Super Key

- Super Key is an attribute set that can uniquely identify a tuple.
